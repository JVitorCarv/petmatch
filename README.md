## What is PetMatch?

PetMatch is a tinder-like matching software for pets. Just as people need connections, so do our pets, especially after these tough lockdown times, where many pets found themselves feeling lonely quite often. With that in mind, we came up with the idea of developing this software.

PetMatch is developed by university students to practice the lessons learned in our classes.
